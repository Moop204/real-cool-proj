Near westpoint, almost every park and the train station. Night or day it's not pleasant. Not at all good for families with children, the schools aren't great either. Invest somewhere better it seems to be getting worse.

it was ratchet, i aint gon do dat

I only relied on the overall rating when deciding to shift here due to work last year. I enjoyed my stay till last December when i gad a break-in. Despite reporting nothing was done. 
I still cant believe that I had someone break in while we were sleeping in the house last week. The cut through the fly screen. 
I recommend staying on first floor orvup at least if you have to shift here.
