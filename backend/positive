Surry Hills has been gentrified but for the most part hasn't lost its uniqueness. It's home to people from all walks of life. I moved back to Surry Hills 3 years ago and have been pleasantly surprised by the level of neighbourliness. There's a real community spirit here. There have been comments posted about seediness and I think they're a bit overstated. I'd rather be a part of a thriving inner city area and the pros (huge range of great cafes, restaurants, fine dining, small bars & pubs, art galleries, dog parks, bike paths, a great primary school, excellent gyms & yoga schools, lively markets, no need for a car etc etc) far outweigh the cons (weekend traffic & parking, weekend queues at the cafes that are attracting the most buzz etc - this can be easily avoided by checking out all the brilliant shops, cafes and galleries that AREN'T on Crown St!)
